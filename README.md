# AlbumTagRemover
* Remove album tag from music files so MacOS Spotlight opens individual files instead of the whole album.
* Adds [foldername].m3u so that all music in a folder can be opened with a music player.

# Dependencies
`pip3 install mutagen`

# Usage
`./album_tagger.py ~/Music/folder [~/Music/more_folders]`
